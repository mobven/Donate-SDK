**Earthquake Relief: Make a Difference with Every Donation**

Together, we can make a difference in the lives of those affected by natural disasters and help to build a better tomorrow.

# 1. Introduction

Every donation, no matter the size, makes a difference and brings us closer to a world where no one has to suffer the effects of earthquakes alone. In light of this, our Android, iOS, and Web SDKs allow you to integrate a donation list into your mobile apps or your web, which provides your customers with a convenient way to donate to official platforms through our SDK. By integrating our SDK, you can help promote charitable giving and make a real impact.

# 2. Aim

Our Android, iOS, and Web SDK simplify the process of adding a donation list to your mobile apps and your web, making it easier for you to incorporate donation functionality and for your users to donate to official platforms. The SDK provides pre-built components that can be easily integrated into your app or your web, streamlining the development process and saving time for you. Ultimately, the SDK aims to encourage charitable giving by providing a convenient and accessible way for users to make donations.

# 3. Where to Start

Our SDK is a versatile tool that allows developers to quickly and easily integrate a donation list into their mobile apps and web pages. The SDK provides a set of pre-built components that can be customized to match the look and feel of the app or web page.

For iOS, Android and Web, the SDK includes native libraries that can be easily imported into an app project. These libraries provide access to the donation list components allowing developers to add and customize the list as needed. The SDK also includes documentation and sample code to help developers get started.
